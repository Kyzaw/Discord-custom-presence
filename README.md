# Discord-custom-presence
#Discord Custom Presence allows users to display custom statuses indicating activity or personal information on their Discord profile. The feature uses Discord's Rich Presence API to customize details like what users are doing, what images are displayed, and even add clickable buttons to direct others to websites or social media links. This is an effective way to share more about yourself or promote a project while interacting within the Discord community.
